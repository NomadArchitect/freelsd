# freelsd
An attempt to make an OS, following the [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org) along with what I presume will be many days of fustration.
See [Lemon](https://github.com/fido2020/Lemon-OS) and [OSDev: Beginner Mistakes](https://wiki.osdev.org/Beginner_Mistakes) for reasons I shouldn't be doing this.

## Features
   - Interrupt handling (keyboard/timer)
   - Stack smashing protection
   - Printing in kernel mode
   - Multiboot compatible
   - Terminal scrolling
   - Can hang itself

p.s if you want to compile, use nasm and i686-elf-g++ (that's what I used.)
